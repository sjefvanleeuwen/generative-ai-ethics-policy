# Human Oversight

**Objective**

Ensure appropriate human review and intervention in generative AI processes to maintain control, accountability, and alignment with human values.

**Scope**

All generative AI systems regardless of autonomy level, with particular focus on high-risk applications and consequential decisions.

**Key Requirements**

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Requirement | Description | Owner | Timeline |
| Oversight Design | Integrate human review points within AI workflows | IT Engineering | System design phase |
| Authority Matrix | Define who can override AI decisions and in what circumstances | Business Unit Lead | Before deployment |
| Training Program | Specialized training for human reviewers | HR  | Before assignment |
| Oversight Metrics | Track and monitor AI/human agreement and override rates | AI Ethics Board | Monthly reporting |

**Procedures**

1.  Complete Human Oversight Checklist ([Annex J: Human Oversight Checklist](annex-j.md)) for each AI system.
2.  Design clear escalation paths for reviewers encountering edge cases.
3.  Document all human overrides of AI decisions with rationale.
4.  Review override patterns quarterly to identify potential AI improvements.

**Controls & Metrics**

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Metric | Target | Frequency | Owner |
| Human Review Coverage | 100% of high-risk outputs reviewed | Daily monitoring | Business Unit Lead |
| Override Documentation | 100% of overrides documented | Weekly audit | AI Ethics Board |
| False Positive Rate | Trending downward month-over-month | Monthly | Technical Review Committee |

**Review Cycle**

*   Oversight requirements: Semi-annually
*   Reviewer performance: Quarterly
