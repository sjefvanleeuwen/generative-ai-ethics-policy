# Regulatory Compliance

**Objective**

Ensure all generative AI systems comply with applicable EU and national laws, regulations, and industry standards, and maintain comprehensive documentation to demonstrate compliance during internal and external audits.

**Scope**

Applies to every stage of the AI lifecycle�design, development, procurement, deployment, monitoring, and retirement�for all AI systems classified as medium‑ or high‑risk under the EU AI Act, as well as any AI processing personal data under GDPR.

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Regulation / Standard | Applicability | Key Requirements | Responsible Party |
| EU AI Act | All high/medium risk AI | Risk classification, conformity assessment, transparency, human oversight | AI Ethics Board, DPO |
| GDPR | All AI processing personal data | DPIAs, lawful basis, data minimisation, data subject rights | DPO, HR, IT Engineering |
| EU Equal Treatment Laws | AI decisions affecting individuals | Non-discrimination, bias mitigation | HR, AI Ethics Board |
| EU Green Deal | AI environmental impact | Sustainability reporting, carbon footprint reduction | Sustainability Office |
| ISO/IEC 27001 | Information security | Risk management, access controls | IT Security |

**Roles & Responsibilities**

*   **AI Ethics Board:** Final approval of compliance strategy; oversight of conformity assessments.
*   **Data Protection Officer:** Lead DPIAs; maintain compliance register; manage regulator inquiries.
*   **Legal:** Review policy exceptions; ensure alignment with evolving EU legislation.
*   **IT Engineering:** Implement technical controls; produce evidence for audits.
*   **HR:** Ensure GDPR and Equal Treatment compliance in HR-related AI use.

*   For high-risk AI, conduct internal conformity assessment using EU AI Act templates.
*   Engage third-party auditors annually for external review.

7.  **Transparency & Disclosure:**

**Controls & Metrics**

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| External Audit Pass Rate | 100% | Annual | AI Ethics Board |

**Non-Compliance & Escalation**
