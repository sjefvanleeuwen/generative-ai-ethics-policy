# Risk Management

**Objective**

Systematically identify, assess, mitigate, and monitor risks associated with generative AI systems to ensure they are developed and deployed responsibly.

**Scope**

All potential risks across the entire AI system lifecycle, including technical, ethical, legal, reputational, and societal risks.

**Key Requirements**

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Requirement | Description | Owner | Timeline |
| Risk Assessment | Formal process to identify and classify AI risks | Business Unit Lead | Project initiation |
| Risk Register | Central repository of identified risks and mitigation actions | IT Security | Maintain continuously |
| Mitigation Planning | Documented plan for handling medium/high/critical risks | Business Unit Lead | Post-assessment |
| Risk Reviews | Regular reassessment of risk ratings and effectiveness of controls | Technical Review Committee | Quarterly |

**Procedures**

1.  Complete AI Risk Assessment Form (Annex F).
2.  Quantify risks using the Risk Scoring Matrix (Annex G).
3.  Add to Risk Register with proposed mitigations.
4.  Implement and verify mitigations before production.

**Controls & Metrics**

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Metric | Target | Frequency | Owner |
| Risk Assessment Completion | 100% of AI initiatives | At initiation | Business Unit Lead |
| High/Critical Risk Mitigation | 100% addressed before deployment | Before go-live | Business Unit Lead |
| Reassessment Compliance | Quarterly reviews of all high/critical risks | Quarterly | Technical Review Committee |

**Review Cycle**

*   Risk assessment process: Annually
*   Risk register: Quarterly
