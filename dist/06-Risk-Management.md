# Risk Management

**Objective**

Identify, assess, prioritize, mitigate, and monitor all risks arising from generative AI systems to ensure they operate safely, ethically, and in compliance with legal and organizational requirements.

**Scope**

Covers all generative AI projects and systems at every stage of the lifecycle�including ideation, design, procurement, deployment, maintenance, and decommissioning�for all business units.

**Risk Taxonomy**

All AI-related risks are categorized into five domains:

|     |     |     |
| 


------ | --- | --- |
| Category | Description | Examples |
| Bias & Fairness | Potential discriminatory or unequal outcomes | Algorithmic bias in hiring decisions, unequal customer support responses |
| Privacy & Data Protection | Risks to personal data confidentiality, integrity, availability | Unlawful data processing, re-identification of anonymized data |
| Security & Robustness | Vulnerabilities to malicious attacks or failures | Model poisoning, adversarial inputs, data breaches |
| Environmental | Negative environmental impacts from AI compute | High energy consumption, carbon emissions from model training |
| Intellectual Property | Legal risks around ownership, licensing, infringement | Use of copyrighted training data, unclear output ownership |

**Risk Assessment Process**

1.  **Risk Identification:** Business Unit Leads document potential risks using the AI Risk Register template (Annex F).
2.  **Risk Analysis:** Quantify each risk�s likelihood and impact using a standardized scoring matrix (Annex G).
3.  **Risk Prioritization:** Classify risks as Low, Medium, High, or Critical based on combined scores.
4.  **Risk Mitigation Planning:** Develop mitigation plans for Medium+ risks, including technical controls, process changes, or stakeholder communication.
5.  **Risk Approval:** Submit mitigation plan for review and approval by Technical Review Committee and AI Ethics Board for High/Critical risks.
6.  **Risk Tracking:** Log all risks and mitigation actions in the Compliance Register; update status monthly.

**Risk Mitigation Strategies**

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Risk Category | Mitigation Controls | Owner | Timeline |
| Bias & Fairness | Bias audits, diverse training datasets, fairness testing | IT Engineering, HR | Quarterly |
| Privacy | Data minimization, encryption, anonymization | DPO, IT Security | Ongoing |
| Security | Adversarial testing, access controls, incident response drills | IT Security | Quarterly |
| Environmental | Model efficiency benchmarks, carbon offset programs | Sustainability Office | Annual |
| IP  | License verification, provenance documentation | Procurement, Legal | Per project |

**Monitoring & Reporting**

*   Maintain a live AI Risk Dashboard tracking all active risks, mitigation status, and residual risk levels.
*   Conduct quarterly risk review meetings chaired by the AI Ethics Board.
*   Produce a semi-annual Risk Management Report summarizing new, mitigated, and escalated risks.

**Documentation Requirements**

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Document | Description | Retention Period | Owner |
| AI Risk Register | Detailed log of identified risks and mitigation plans | Until risk closure + 3 years | Business Unit Leads |
| Risk Assessment Report | Formal analysis of Medium+ risks | 5 years | DPO |
| Mitigation Action Log | Status of all mitigation tasks | Until risk closure + 3 years | IT Security |
| Risk Review Minutes | Records of quarterly review meetings | 5 years | AI Ethics Board Secretary |

**Roles & Responsibilities**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Role | Responsibility |
| Business Unit Leads | Identify, document, and track risks for their AI use cases |
| Technical Review Committee | Validate risk assessments and approve mitigation plans |
| IT Security | Implement security controls and conduct adversarial tests |
| HR  | Lead bias and fairness assessments for HR systems |
| Sustainability Office | Measure and report environmental impacts; propose efficiency improvements |
| Procurement | Ensure third-party vendors provide risk documentation |
| AI Ethics Board | Oversee risk governance, approve critical risk mitigations, and escalate as needed |
| DPO | Review privacy risks, approve risk assessments, ensure GDPR compliance |

**Metrics & Targets**

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Metric | Target | Frequency | Owner |
| % of AI projects with completed Risk Assessments | 100% | Quarterly | DPO |
| % of High/Critical risks with mitigation plans | 100% | Monthly | AI Ethics Board |
| Average time to close mitigation actions | ≤ 90 days | Quarterly | IT Security |
| Residual Risk Score Reduction | ≥ 20% reduction year-over-year | Annual | AI Ethics Board |

**Review Cycle**

*   Risk Management framework reviewed annually and updated to reflect emerging threats, regulatory changes, and audit findings.
