## üìã What's Included

This framework provides a complete enterprise solution for AI governance:

- **Core Policy (20+ Sections)**: Covers everything from governance structures to risk management, transparency requirements, human oversight protocols, and more
- **Interactive Process Diagrams**: 8 BPMN diagrams visualizing key workflows like AI risk assessment, incident response, and vendor vetting
- **Implementation Templates (15+ Annexes)**: Ready-to-use forms for DPIAs, incident response, explainability reports, and more
- **"At a Glance" Poster**: Visual summary of core requirements for easy employee reference

### Key Policy Components

- **Governance Framework**: Clear roles and responsibilities for AI oversight
- **Risk Management**: Structured approach to AI risk assessment with matrices and templates
- **Transparency & Explainability**: Requirements for making AI systems understandable
- **Human Oversight**: Processes ensuring humans maintain control over AI decisions
- **Employee Rights**: Protections for data privacy and appeal mechanisms
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Alignment with EU AI Act, GDPR, and global regulations
- **Practical Implementation**: Roadmap, rollout plans, and executive approval templates

## üõ†Ô∏è How This Was Built

This project demonstrates the power of AI-assisted development:

- **GitHub Copilot**: Used for code generation and policy drafting
- **Claude 3.7 Sonnet**: Leveraged for complex policy content and reasoning
- **BPMN.io**: Integrated for interactive process diagrams
- **Markdown + JavaScript**: Static site generation for easy deployment
- **GitHub Pages**: Seamless publishing via GitHub Actions

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- npm

```

## üîß Customization

### Adapting for Your Organization

1. **Policy Content**: Edit the markdown (.md) files to align with your organization's requirements
2. **Process Diagrams**: Modify BPMN files using [BPMN.io](https://bpmn.io/toolkit/bpmn-js/) and save to the `bpmn/` directory
3. **Company Branding**: Update styles in the build.js file to match your corporate identity
4. **Regulatory Focus**: Emphasize sections relevant to your jurisdiction and industry

### Implementation Strategy

Start with the key sections most relevant to your immediate needs:

1. Review the Executive Summary and Governance structure
2. Complete the Risk Assessment templates for your AI systems
3. Implement the core technical measures from Data Governance and Security
4. Roll out training using the provided materials
5. Establish monitoring mechanisms described in the Audit section

## üì§ Deployment

This project is configured for GitHub Pages deployment via GitHub Actions:

1. Fork/push to your GitHub repository
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
3. The Action workflow will build and deploy automatically

For other hosting options, the `dist/` directory contains all deployment files.
