# Accessibility & Inclusion

**Objective**

Ensure that generative AI systems and their outputs are designed, developed, and deployed to be accessible to all users &mdash; including people with disabilities &mdash; and promote equitable outcomes.

**Scope**

Applies to all user-facing AI applications and internal tools used by employees or external stakeholders, covering digital interfaces, generated content, and support services.

**Key Requirements**

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Requirement | Description | Owner | Timeline |
| WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance | All AI interfaces and outputs must meet or exceed WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards | IT Engineering | Ongoing |
| Inclusive Design Review | Conduct accessibility impact assessments during design and prior to deployment | UX/UI Team | Pre-deployment |
| Bias Mitigation Scorecards | Evaluate AI outputs across demographic groups to detect disparities in accessibility | HR & IT Engineering | Quarterly |
| User Feedback Mechanism | Provide accessible channels for users to report accessibility issues | Call Center | Ongoing |

**Procedures**

1.  **Accessibility Impact Assessment:** Use [Annex L: Accessibility Assessment](annex-l.md) template to evaluate compliance during design and development phases.
2.  **Automated & Manual Testing:** Perform automated scans and manual testing (screen readers, keyboard navigation) before release.
3.  **Issue Tracking & Remediation:** Log accessibility defects in central issue tracker; remediate within SLA of 30 days.
4.  **User Feedback Loop:** Monitor feedback channels and integrate findings into iterative improvements.

**Documentation Requirements**

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Document | Description | Retention Period | Location |
| Accessibility Assessment Reports | Results from impact assessments and testing | 5 years | Compliance Repository |
| Issue Tracker Logs | Records of identified issues and remediation status | 3 years | Secure Audit Log System |
| User Feedback Reports | Summarized feedback and resolution actions | 5 years | Compliance Repository |

**Roles & Responsibilities**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Role | Responsibility |
| IT Engineering | Implement accessibility controls; conduct technical testing |
| UX/UI Team | Lead design reviews; ensure interface accessibility |
| Call Center | Manage user feedback intake and triage issues |
| AI Ethics Board | Review accessibility performance metrics and approve remediation plans |
| HR  | Monitor equity in AI-driven HR tools for accessibility impact |

**Controls & Metrics**

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Metric | Target | Frequency | Owner |
| Accessibility Compliance Rate | 100% of AI interfaces meet WCAG 2.1 AA | Quarterly | IT Engineering |
| Accessibility Defect Closure Rate | 100% defects resolved within SLA | Monthly | IT Engineering |
| User Satisfaction Score (Accessibility) | ≥ 90% | Semi-annual | Call Center |
| Bias Disparity Index | ≤ 5% difference across demographic groups | Quarterly | HR & IT Engineering |

**Review Cycle**

*   Accessibility controls and processes reviewed annually; update guidelines based on user feedback and evolving standards.
